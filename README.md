# BreakOut
This is a recreation of BreakOut game in Assembly I made in 2013.
If you want to run this game, you need to download [emu8086](https://emu8086-microprocessor-emulator.en.softonic.com/download). This is an emulator for the 8086 processor, and the code gives direct commands to it.

Move with the 4 and 6 keys, try to erase all the blocks from the screen.
